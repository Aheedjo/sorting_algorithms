# Sorting Algorithm and Big O Notation

This repository provides an overview of sorting algorithms and their corresponding Big O notations. Understanding sorting algorithms is crucial for efficient data manipulation and retrieval in computer science. Additionally, Big O notation helps assess the efficiency and scalability of these algorithms as the input size grows.

## Sorting Algorithms

This repository covers several common sorting algorithms, including:

1. **Bubble Sort:** A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

2. **Selection Sort:** Another simple algorithm that divides the input into a sorted and an unsorted region, repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and swapping it with the first element of the unsorted region.

3. **Insertion Sort:** Builds the final sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly taking elements from the unsorted part and inserting them into their correct position in the sorted part.

4. **Merge Sort:** A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

5. **Quick Sort:** Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

## Big O Notation

Big O notation is a way to express the efficiency of algorithms in terms of their performance relative to the input size. Here's a brief overview:

- **O(1):** Constant time complexity. The algorithm's runtime or space requirements remain constant regardless of the input size.

- **O(log n):** Logarithmic time complexity. Common in algorithms that reduce the problem size in each step, like binary search.

- **O(n):** Linear time complexity. The runtime grows linearly with the size of the input.

- **O(n log n):** Linearithmic time complexity. Common in efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Quick Sort.

- **O(n^2):** Quadratic time complexity. Common in algorithms with nested iterations, like Bubble Sort.

- **O(2^n):** Exponential time complexity. Common in recursive algorithms that solve a problem by recursively solving two smaller problems.

- **O(n!):** Factorial time complexity. Extremely inefficient. Rarely seen in practice.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the provided sorting algorithms and their implementations in the corresponding directories. Each algorithm comes with a detailed explanation of its logic and the corresponding Big O notation.
